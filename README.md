# k-nearest-neighbors-c
k-nearest neighbors algorithm programed in c

This is a simple implementation of the k-nearest-neighbors algorithm written in c. The algorithm for classification is based on the euclidean distance between two vectors. First the distance between a new vector and every vector in the datasets is calculated, then the k nearest distances are used to classify the new vector.
